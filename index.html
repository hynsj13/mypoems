<p> <font color="#FFFFFF"><center>this is a place for all of my poetry, prose, and other fragments of my imagination that somehow manifested in textual language. where i catch myself in the slippage of reality. where i'm lost. where i'm found. essentially, an extension of my subconscious landscapes.</font></p>

<p><center><font color="#FFFFFF">truthfully, i've never been a fan of anything resembling structure. i grew up with enough structure for the both of us and it makes me physically ill thinking about it. if i feel like repeating, i repeat. if i feel like rhyming, i rhyme. please allow yourself to be fluid in this space. drifting between the words and allowing boundaries to dissolve. there never were any in the first place. enjoy<3</font></center><p>
